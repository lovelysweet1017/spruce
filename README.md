## Installation

Clone the repo locally then install all the dependencies using [NPM](https://npmjs.org/)

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/DivySrivastava/leaflet.git
$ cd leaflet
$ npm i
```

## Local Development
Before running, we need to add the Instgram API Credentials to the project.
Under the `config` directory of the repo, you will find `instagram.js`.
We need to add the `<CLIENT_ID>`, `<CLIENT_SECRET>` and `<host>:<port>` with our own API credentials

```js
/** REPLACE YOUR API CREDENTIALS HERE **/
var in_client_id = 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX', // <CLIENT_ID>
	in_client_secret = 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX', // <CLIENT_SECRET>
```

Now Replace the `<host>` & `<port>` with the redirect uri specified in the [Instgram API Dashboard](https://www.instagram.com/developer).
Default is `http://localhost:80/account/oauth`.
```js
var in_redirect_uri = 'http://localhost:80/account/oauth'
```

One last thing is to specify the instagram config file in our authentication router and API.
Under the file `routes/auth.js` and `routes/api/v1/index.js` change the `config` file path to `instagram.js`.

```js
// routes/auth.js
/** REPLACE INSTAGRAM CONFIG PATH HERE **/
var config = require('../config/instagram.js');
```
```js
// routes/api/v1/index.js
/** SET YOUR instagram config path over here **/
var ig = require('../config/instagram.js');
```

Finally start the MongoDB server
```bash
$ mongod
```
and then start the leaflet server via `npm`.
```bash
$ npm start
```   
## To know

leaflet uses [mongoose](https://npmjs.org/package/mongoose) as an ORM for performing CRUD operations on MongoDB and [express.js](https://npmjs.com/package/express) for server-side HTTP routing.
